<h3>BlueFlyVario Adapter for Paraglider Dashboard</h3>
This app provides a service to connect the <a href="http://www.blueflyvario.com/">BlueFlyVario</a> 
 (the BT version) with the <a href="market://details?id=com.eb.ohrh.parawind.free">Paraglider Dashboard App.</a> 
</br>If a BlueFlyVario is connected via bluetooth, the variometer of Paraglider Dashboard will 
show the rate of descent or climb based on atmospheric pressure rather than on GPS data.
<h3>Connection Setup</h3>
</p>Select the BlueFlyVario device and pair it with your smartphone if not yet done.
The app will try to connect and will show the current atmospheric pressure and 
the battery value in case of successful connection. (It may take several tries until successful connection.)
</br>That's all. This app is only needed once, for selecting the BFV device.
After that Paraglider Dashboard will automatically connect to the BlueFlyVario.
<h3>Hardware setup</h3>
</p>This app does not support hardware configuration of the BlueFlyVario.
Use the <a href="market://details?id=com.bfv">BlueFlyVario App</a> for changing hardware settings.
You must disconnect the BFV from this app or close it before connecting to the BlueFlyVario app.
<h3>Why a separate app</h3>
You may ask, why this function is not build-in directly into Paraglider Dashboard.
The reason is, that users do not like to accept additional permissions, like e.g. bluetooth
connection, especially if bluetooth is not needed for the majority of users.
Having this app as a mediator, Paraglider Dashboard does not
need bluetooth permission, but can still connect to the BlueFlyVario. 
<h3>How it works</h3>
The app installs a service, which can be started and stopped by Paraglider Dashboard.
The service runs only as long as Paraglider Dashboard is running.
The task of the service is to read the pressure data from the BlueFlyVario and to send it to Paraglider Dashboard.
